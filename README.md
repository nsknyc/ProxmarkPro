# ProxmarkPro - Findings
I trying to gather as much info on this wonderful device.<br/>
It seems that the ryscc.com has been down for quite some time, and I would like to share my findings.
The zip files contains the last known (afaik) firmware update for the proxmark pro kit, which I was able to retrieve via
wayback machine. You can find the guide in pdf format as well.
